I'm here to set the record straight: armed with a mathematics minor, I've got a solid grasp on the intricacies of math (and a good laugh to go with it!). Currently, I'm diving into a specialized program to hone my skills in calculus, statistics, and linear algebra, all in preparation for an upcoming certification. Thanks for dropping by my repository!
