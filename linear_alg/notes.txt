Linear Equations (W1)
=====================
complete (non-singular) - unique solution to system
redundant  (singular) - infinite solutions
contradictory (singular) - no solutions

- singularity is not determined by the output constants!!!
- singular matrices can associate the params of the matrix (e.g. a = -b)

- if a row of a matrix can equate another, then linear dependence (singular)
- otherwise independence (non-singular)

determinant (2x2 matrix) -> ad - bc = 0 ([[a,b], [c,d]])
 - if 0 --> singular (dependence)
 - else --> non-singular (independence)
 - (3x3 matrix) = a x det([[e,f],[h,i]]) - b x det([[d,f],[g,i]]) + c x det([[d,e],[g,h]])
   + [[a,b,c],[d,e,f],[g,h,i]]

Solving a System of Linear Equations (W2)
=========================================
- singular (redundant) => get 2 subtracted equations that cause 0=0
- singular (contradictory) => get 2 subtracted equations that cause (e.g. 0=2)
- use the elimination method (review)
  + row reduction (gaussian)

row echelon form
 - diagnonal of 1/0's
 - everything below diagnonal is 0
 - everything above is whatever
