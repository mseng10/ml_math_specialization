Linear Equations (W1)
=====================
complete (non-singular) - unique solution to system
redundant  (singular) - infinite solutions
contradictory (singular) - no solutions

- singularity is not determined by the output constants!!!
- singular matrices can associate the params of the matrix (e.g. a = -b)

- if a row of a matrix can equate another, then linear dependence (singular)
- otherwise independence (non-singular)

determinant (2x2 matrix) -> ad - bc = 0 ([[a,b], [c,d]])
 - if 0 --> singular (dependence)
 - else --> non-singular (independence)
 - (3x3 matrix) = a x det([[e,f],[h,i]]) - b x det([[d,f],[g,i]]) + c x det([[d,e],[g,h]])
   + [[a,b,c],[d,e,f],[g,h,i]]

Solving a System of Linear Equations (W2)
=========================================
- singular (redundant) => get 2 subtracted equations that cause 0=0
- singular (contradictory) => get 2 subtracted equations that cause (e.g. 0=2)
- use the elimination method (review)
  + row reduction (gaussian)

row echelon form
 - diagnonal of 1/0's
 - everything below diagnonal is 0
 - everything above is whatever

Rank - 

Vector Algebra
==============
norm (a,b) = sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
l1 norm = sum of absolute value of components
 - |a| + |b|
   + v = [a,b]
l2 noprm = sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

sum - [a,b], [c,d] = [a+c, b+d]
subtraction - [a,b], [c,d] = [a-c, b-d]
scalar multiplicat - [a,b]*c = [a*c, b*c]
dot product - you know.
multiplication - matrix of dot products
distance between 2 vectors - swrt((a-c)**2 + (b-d)**2)


identity matrix - diagnonal of ones (rest are 0s)
 - matrix inverse * matrix = identity matrix
 - matrix has an inverse if it's non-singular
 - matrix does not have an inverse if it's singular

PCA
===
- dimension of linear transformation = Rank
- area of a linear transformation = determinant
- Det(AB) = det(A)det(B)
   + if det(B) = 0 -> det(AB) = 0
- det(A^-1) = 1 / det(A)

span - everywhere a set of vectors can reach
bases - minimum spanning set
 - satifies - 1) span in vector space, 2) are linearly independent
 - bases = dimension
vectors that are dependent can be expressed as a combination
 - linear ind. - no function can be made between vectors
 - linear dep. - function can be made between vectors
