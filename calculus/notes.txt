Derivatives (easy review)
 - slope = delta(y) / delta(x) (duhhhhh)
 - dy/dx - slope of the tangent line (instantansious rate of change)
   + slope of 0 = maximum or minimum of a function (local)
 - derivative of constant = 0 (duhh)
 - derivative of line (y = mx + b) -> m (duhh)
 - derivative of quadratic (y = x**2) -> 2x (duhh)
 - derivative of cubic (y = x**3) -> 3x**2 (duhh)
 - derivative of 1/x = x ** -1 -> -1x**-2
 - derivative of power function (nx**n-1)
 - derivative of inverse g'(y) = 1 / f'(x)
 - derivative of trig function (duh)
 - derivative of e**x = e**x
 - derivative of log(x) = 1/(x)

- differential function (derivative exists at every point)
- non-differential function (e.g. funciton has a corner)
  + cusp or corner
  + piece wise function as well
  + vertical tangents

properties:
scalar - f = cg --> f'x = (c)g'x
sum rules - f = g + h --> f' = g' + h'
product rule - f = gh --> f' = g'h + gh'
chain rule! - g(h(x)) --> dg/dh * dh/dx

optimization
- square loss
- log loss
