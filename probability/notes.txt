What is probability? (hmmmm I wonder)

compliment rule - P(A') = 1 - P(A)
 - opposite.. duhh

Disjoit Sum - P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B)
 - mutually exclusive
Join Sum (when not disjoin) - P(A U B) =  P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
 - non-mutually exclusive

Product Rule - P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)
 - assuming independence

Conditional Probability - P(B | A) = P(B) (when independence)

Bayes Theorem - 
 - P(A) x P(B | A) / (P(A) x P(B | A) + P(A') x P(B | A')
