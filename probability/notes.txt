What is probability? (hmmmm I wonder)

compliment rule - P(A') = 1 - P(A)
 - opposite.. duhh

Disjoit Sum - P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B)
 - mutually exclusive
Join Sum (when not disjoin) - P(A U B) =  P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
 - non-mutually exclusive

Product Rule - P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)
 - assuming independence

Conditional Probability - P(B | A) = P(B) (when independence)

Bayes Theorem - 
 - P(A) x P(B | A) / (P(A) x P(B | A) + P(A') x P(B | A')
 - prior - 
 - event - 
 - posterior

Naive Bayes Theorem - assume independence amongst predictors
 - way to shorten number of calculations

Random Variables
 - discrete - finite number of values
 - continuous - infinite number of values

Probability Distribution
 - discrete 
    + PMF = P_x(X)

binomial distribution - (N X) p**x * (1-p)**n-x
 - x is event
 - n is total events

bernoulli distribution - P (x) - probability of success

PDF - f_x(X) - continuous values
 - P(a < X < b) = area under f_x(X) 

Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
 - sum of all probabilities up to X
 - X=N -> 1
 - P(X <= x) = F_X(X)

Uniform Distribution
 - CDF 
   + 0 X < 
   + x-a/b-a  a<=x<b
   + 1 b <=x

Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)
 -
